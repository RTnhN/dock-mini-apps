# Toggl

This application gets the current running Toggl timer. You can enter the Toggl api in the application settings interface. To stop the current timer, you can press the encoder button. 

Note: due to limitations in the Toggl api, you might need to wait a couple minutes for the timer to update. Free account only get 30 api calls per hour, so the smallest that you will be able to get the delay down is 2 minutes. If you use other Toggl based apps, this will need to be even longer. I can maybe make the encoder button send a request right away if short press and stop if long press.
